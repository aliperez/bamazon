<h1>About</h1>

<p>Bamazon is a CLI that allows users to browse items and make a purchase.  The user is first prompted to select an item by ID.  Then they are asked how many of that item they would like to purchase.  If Bamazon has enough of that item in stock, the purchase is completed.  The user will see the total cost of their purchase, and the quantity of that item will be updated in the database.  If Bamazon does not have enough of the desired item in stock, the user will receive an error message and start over.  At the end of each transaction, the user is asked if they would like to continue shopping or quit the application.</p>
