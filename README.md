<h1>About</h1>

<p>Bamazon is a CLI that allows users to browse items and make a purchase.  The user is first prompted to select an item by ID.  Then they are asked how many of that item they would like to purchase.  If Bamazon has enough of that item in stock, the purchase is completed.  The user will see the total cost of their purchase, and the quantity of that item will be updated in the database.  If Bamazon does not have enough of the desired item in stock, the user will receive an error message and start over.  At the end of each transaction, the user is asked if they would like to continue shopping or quit the application.</p>

<h2>Our Latest Update:</h2>
<p>Bamazon Manager is here!  With our latest update, Bamazon managers can check, update, and add to existing Bamazon inventory in an easy to use interface.  The manager is first prompted to select one of five options: (1) View Products for Sale, (2) View Low Inventory, (3) Add to Inventory, (4) Add New Product, or (5) Quit.  The first option displays all items in stock at Bamazon.  The second option displays all items which have fewer than 5 units remaining in stock.  The third option allows managers to increase (upon new arival of products) or decrease (in the case of errors) the stock quantity.  The fourth option allows managers to add brand new items for sale on Bamazon.  Each time the manager is finished with a transaction, they will be re-prompted with the five options.  Once updates are complete, simply select Quit.</p>
